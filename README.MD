### This repository provide supplementary material, including:

### Code
>>#### load data.py - Loading data from xlxs file to pkl. I/O routines
>>#### Model implementation.py - The deep neural networks (1D-CNN&DMLP) implementated in Keras.
### Dataset
>>#### At present, we have not decided how to uploard large capacity dataset. Will be confirmed after consultation with editor.
